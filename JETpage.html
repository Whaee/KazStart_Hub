                <p><strong>Company Overview</strong></p>
                <p>JET Sharing operates in the micromobility and power-sharing sectors, offering electric scooter rentals and portable power bank services. Through their mobile app, users can easily rent and return scooters across multiple cities. The company is active in countries such as Kazakhstan and Brazil, with plans to expand further across regions with high demand for micromobility solutions</p>
                <p><strong>Market Opportunity</strong></p>
                <p>JET Sharing operates in the rapidly growing micro-mobility market, which is increasingly seen as a solution to urban traffic congestion and pollution. Electric scooter sharing has become popular in densely populated areas where traditional forms of transportation are inefficient. Currently, many cities in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia, remain underserved in this sector, presenting a significant growth opportunity. Additionally, JET’s power bank sharing service addresses the growing demand for portable charging solutions, expanding its market reach across multiple consumer needs​</p>
                <p><strong>Business Model</strong></p>
                <p>JET Sharing operates through a franchise model, allowing partners to set up operations in their local areas. The company’s revenue streams come from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p><ol>Scooter Rentals: Customers use the JET app to rent electric scooters, paying per minute of use. The convenience of picking up and dropping off scooters at designated parking areas enhances user retention.</ol></p>
                    <p><ol>Power Bank Rentals: In addition to scooters, JET offers power bank rentals at charging stations located in high-traffic areas.</ol></p>
                    <ol>Franchise Fees: Franchisees invest in a fleet of scooters and receive operational support from JET in exchange for a commission on revenues. Franchise partners typically break even in under one season (3-4 months)​</ol>
                </ul>    
                <p><strong>Operational Strategy</strong></p>
                <p>JET focuses on ensuring the quality and availability of its fleet. Key operational processes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p><ol>Logistics and Maintenance: JET operates service centers to provide training for franchise partners on scooter maintenance and logistics management. Proper upkeep of scooters and timely relocation to high-demand areas are crucial to the company's operational success</ol></p>
                    <ol>Customer Experience: The app is user-friendly, allowing customers to register quickly and start using scooters or power banks within minutes. The app supports seamless payment options and provides access to services across multiple cities, reducing friction for frequent users​</ol>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Expansion Strategy</strong></p>
                <p>JET Sharing’s expansion strategy relies on rapidly growing its fleet and entering new markets through franchise partnerships. They are particularly targeting cities with populations over 500,000, where competition is still low. The company also leverages the high visibility of its branded scooters as free outdoor advertising, reducing marketing costs​</p>
                <p><strong>Financial Plan</strong></p>
                <p>JET’s financial model is designed to deliver rapid returns for franchisees. Initial investment starts from $30,000 for a fleet of at least 100 scooters, with a break-even period of under one season. The franchise system is highly scalable, with operational costs for maintaining 300 scooters only marginally higher than for 100 scooters, but with significantly higher returns. Franchise partners are not required to allocate additional budget for social media marketing, as JET’s large scooter fleet naturally generates brand visibility and user interest​​</p>
                <p><strong>Risk Management</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <p><ol>Competition: As more companies enter the electric scooter sharing space, maintaining a competitive edge through efficient operations and customer satisfaction is key. JET’s focus on service quality, operational efficiency, and local partnerships helps mitigate competitive risks.</ol></p>
                    <ol>Regulatory Challenges: The company actively works with local governments to ensure compliance with regulations regarding scooter use and public safety, helping to avoid potential legal issues.​</ol>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <p>JET Sharing is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for urban mobility solutions. Through its franchise model, the company ensures scalability while delivering consistent operational and financial support to its partners. The company’s focus on user experience, operational efficiency, and market expansion make it a competitive player in the micro-mobility industry.​​</p>
